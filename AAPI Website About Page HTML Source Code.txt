     <h1>Who is the AAPI community?</h1>
     <h2 class="aboutTxt"> AAPI stands for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The AAPI community isn't a single monolithic group. Instead, it is an umbrella term for East Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, Pacific Islander, and other Asians. Each of these subgroups have members that trace their cultures, ethnicities, and histories back to different stories. As a result, their experience in the United States drastically varies between each other.</h2>
